Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with understanding and generating vernacular language, especially when dealing with rapidly evolving slang, dialects, and sociolects. This limitation hinders their ability to effectively communicate in diverse linguistic contexts and adapt to the dynamic nature of language evolution.\n\n2. Motivation: Current approaches to improving LLMs' performance on vernacular language tasks typically rely on fine-tuning on contemporary corpora or using static translation pairs. However, these methods quickly become outdated due to the rapid evolution of vernacular expressions. Our proposed method, DiaSNav, is inspired by the observation that language evolution follows patterns. By simulating the diachronic evolution of language and creating temporal semantic graphs, we can develop a more robust system for vernacular understanding that can adapt to new expressions based on observed patterns of semantic shift.\n\n3. Proposed Method: DiaSNav (Diachronic Semantic Navigation for Vernacular Understanding) works by prompting the LLM to generate a temporal semantic graph for each concept, tracing its evolution through time. The graph includes nodes representing the concept's meaning at different time points, with edges indicating semantic shifts. For vernacular expressions, the LLM is prompted to traverse this graph, predicting potential future evolutions based on observed patterns. During inference, the model navigates these diachronic semantic graphs to interpret modern vernacular, effectively 'time-traveling' through semantic space to bridge understanding between standard and vernacular language.\n\n4. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:\n\tStep 1: Dataset Preparation\n\t\t• Collect datasets for vernacular language understanding tasks:\n\t\t\t- Slang interpretation dataset: Compile a dataset of slang terms with their meanings across different time periods.\n\t\t\t- Dialect translation dataset: Gather pairs of sentences in standard language and their dialect equivalents.\n\t\t\t- Sociolect-aware text generation dataset: Create prompts for generating text in specific sociolects.\n\tStep 2: Baseline Model Setup\n\t\t• Implement two baseline models:\n\t\t\t- Contemporary fine-tuning: Fine-tune a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5) on a contemporary vernacular corpus.\n\t\t\t- Static translation: Create a lookup table for vernacular-to-standard language pairs and use it for translation.\n\tStep 3: DiaSNav Implementation\n\t\t• Implement the DiaSNav method:\n\t\t\t- Temporal graph generation: Prompt the LLM to generate temporal semantic graphs for key concepts in the datasets. Example prompt: \"Generate a temporal semantic graph for the concept 'cool' from 1950 to 2023, showing how its meaning has evolved over time.\"\n\t\t\t- Graph traversal: Implement a function to traverse the generated graphs based on input vernacular expressions.\n\t\t\t- Inference mechanism: Develop a method to use the traversed graph information for interpreting or generating vernacular language.\n\tStep 4: Evaluation Setup\n\t\t• Prepare evaluation metrics and procedures:\n\t\t\t- Slang interpretation: Use accuracy and semantic similarity scores.\n\t\t\t- Dialect translation: Employ BLEU score and human evaluation for fluency and meaning preservation.\n\t\t\t- Sociolect-aware generation: Use perplexity and human evaluation for appropriateness and authenticity.\n\tStep 5: Experiment Execution\n\t\t• Run experiments comparing DiaSNav against the baselines:\n\t\t\t- Slang interpretation task: Test models on interpreting slang terms from different time periods.\n\t\t\t- Dialect translation task: Evaluate models on translating between standard language and dialects.\n\t\t\t- Sociolect-aware generation task: Assess models' ability to generate text in specific sociolects.\n\tStep 6: Analysis\n\t\t• Analyze the results:\n\t\t\t- Compare performance metrics across models for each task.\n\t\t\t- Conduct error analysis to identify patterns in successes and failures of DiaSNav.\n\t\t\t- Analyze the generated temporal semantic graphs to gain insights into the model's understanding of language evolution.\n\n5. Test Case Examples:\n\tTest Case 1:\n\t\tBaseline Prompt Input (Contemporary Fine-tuning): Translate the following sentence to standard English: \"That new track is straight fire, no cap.\"\n\t\tBaseline Prompt Expected Output (Contemporary Fine-tuning): The new song is very good, honestly.\n\t\tBaseline Prompt Input (Static Translation): Translate the following sentence to standard English: \"That new track is straight fire, no cap.\"\n\t\tBaseline Prompt Expected Output (Static Translation): That new song is excellent, truthfully.\n\t\tProposed Prompt Input (DiaSNav; Step 1: Temporal Graph Generation): Generate a temporal semantic graph for the concepts \"fire\" and \"cap\" in the context of slang from 2000 to 2023.\n\t\tProposed Prompt Expected Output (DiaSNav; Step 1: Temporal Graph Generation):\n\t\t\tTemporal Semantic Graph for \"fire\":\n\t\t\t2000: [hot, intense] -> 2010: [excellent, exciting] -> 2020: [extremely good, impressive]\n\t\t\tTemporal Semantic Graph for \"cap\":\n\t\t\t2000: [hat, lid] -> 2015: [lie, falsehood] -> 2020: [to lie, to exaggerate] -> 2023: [opposite of truth, used in negation for emphasis]\n\t\tProposed Prompt Input (DiaSNav; Step 2: Graph Traversal): Using the temporal semantic graphs for \"fire\" and \"cap\", interpret the sentence: \"That new track is straight fire, no cap.\"\n\t\tProposed Prompt Expected Output (DiaSNav; Step 2: Graph Traversal):\n\t\t\tInterpretation based on graph traversal:\n\t\t\t\"fire\" (2023): extremely good, impressive\n\t\t\t\"no cap\" (2023): without lying, truthfully\n\t\t\tTranslated sentence: That new track is extremely good, truthfully.\n\t\tExplanation: DiaSNav outperforms the baselines by leveraging temporal semantic information. The contemporary fine-tuning method may struggle with rapidly evolving slang, while the static translation method lacks nuance in interpretation. DiaSNav's graph-based approach allows for more accurate and context-aware interpretation of vernacular expressions.\n\n6. Fallback Plan: If DiaSNav does not show significant improvement over baselines, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of language evolution patterns in LLMs. We could investigate how well LLMs capture diachronic semantic shifts without explicit temporal modeling, and identify specific areas where they struggle. This could involve creating a benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs' understanding of language evolution over time. Additionally, we could explore alternative graph structures or traversal algorithms that might better capture the complexities of vernacular language evolution. Another direction could be to analyze the generated temporal semantic graphs to gain insights into the model's implicit understanding of language change, which could inform future approaches to improving vernacular language understanding in LLMs."
