If successful, it could potentially open up new research directions and methodologies in multilingual NLP.\n\n3. **Scope**:\n   - The use of etymology in NLP is not yet established as a significant method, as evidenced by the lack of substantial prior research or discussions in this area. This suggests that while the idea might offer new exploratory potential, its practical impact and applicability remain to be demonstrated.\n\n4. **Comparative Value**:\n   - Compared to traditional methods relying on parallel corpora or cross-lingual embeddings, the proposed method could provide additional insights and improvements, particularly in the nuanced understanding of semantic connections across languages. However, existing reviews suggest that while innovative, etymological knowledge in NLP has not been proven to have a broad or transformative impact yet.\n\n5. **Exploratory Potential**:\n   - The proposal's novelty lies in its use of etymological relationships to form a multi-dimensional semantic space, which is an uncharted approach. Although the significance of etymological knowledge is assessed as moderate, this idea could pave the way for future explorations if it successfully demonstrates improvements in translation quality.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea is promising and addresses a recognized problem, its significance is currently moderate due to the uncertainty of its impact and the nascent stage of research in applying etymological knowledge in NLP. The method's success in practical applications will be crucial in determining its ultimate influence and value in the field.",
