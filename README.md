## 🚀 Project Overview

**ExpInstructor** is the first agentic AI instructor that emulates
how human mentors leverage past scholarly experience to guide re-
search ideation. ExpInstructor captures human academic experience
by extracting experience triples from large-scale review corpora,
which consist of of knowledge entities and their relationships. It
then constructs Experience Graph from these triples and employs
an agentic reasoning framework for relevant experience retrieval
and experience-driven idea evaluation. We further design metrics
to evaluate correlations between the ExpInstructor and humans
regarding the score and concerns raised.
